## ‚ú® Introduction

**[Project Name]** is a revolutionary platform that leverages blockchain technology to create a win-win ecosystem for users who prioritize health and well-being. It seamlessly combines the excitement of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) with a reward system that incentivizes healthy habits.

### Healthy Lifestyle Incentives

### Dual BMI Verification
- **AI Image Analysis**: Secure weight detection using AI image analysis.
