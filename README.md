## 🚀 Core Features

### Rewardable NFT Ownership
- **Purchase Unique NFTs**: Acquire distinctive NFTs that can grant rewards like some gems in Clash of Clans per month, premium of a service (if they deploy their NFT).
- **Earn by Holding and Selling**: Earn back a portion of your investment when you sell the NFT.

### Healthy Lifestyle Incentives
- **BMI-Based Rewards**: Upload your weekly Body Mass Index (BMI) to earn reward tokens. The system encourages progress towards a healthy BMI range.
- **Health Tracker**: Track your health with our smart dApp with all things decentralised and no fear of private data leaking.

### Dual BMI Verification
- **AI Image Analysis**: Secure body posture and structure monitoring using AI and Machine Learning.
- **Doctor-Certified BMI Certificates**: Upload doctor-certified BMI calculation certificates authenticated by Chainlink oracles.

### Chainlink Integration
- **Data Feed Verification**: Chainlink's Data Feed verifies doctor names and hospital credentials for certificate authenticity.
- **Randomized NFT Minting**: Securely generate unique NFT addresses using Chainlink's Verifiable Random Function (VRF) for fair and transparent distribution.
- **Cross-Chain Functionality**: Enable seamless asset transfer between different blockchains with Chainlink's Cross-Chain Link (not applicable).

## 🕵🏼‍♂️ Inspiration

### Our inspiration for this project came from the desire to merge health and technology in a way that motivates people to stay fit while leveraging the benefits of blockchain.
### We saw an opportunity to use AI for accurate health assessments and blockchain for secure, transparent rewards and transactions. By integrating Chainlink VRF, we ensure fairness and security in our system. ### Our goal is to create a community where users are rewarded for their health efforts and can engage with digital assets in a meaningful way. This project aims to make fitness fun, rewarding, and part of the digital economy.
